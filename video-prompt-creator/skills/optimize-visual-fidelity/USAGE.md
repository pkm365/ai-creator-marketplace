# Optimize Visual Fidelity - Usage Guide

This skill is the "Polisher" or "Cinematographer" of the system. It upgrades raw ideas into high-budget film descriptions.

## Key Features

### The 4 Pillars of Fidelity
It systematically enhances your prompt across four dimensions:
1.  **Photography Gear**: Assigns specific cameras (Alexa 65, IMAX) and lenses (Anamorphic, Macro).
2.  **Lighting & Atmosphere**: Adds physics-based lighting (Volumetric, Subsurface Scattering) and weather.
3.  **Material & Texture**: Describes the tactile quality of surfaces (Oxidized copper, Silk, Distressed leather).
4.  **Camera Movement**: Defines professional camera moves (Dolly Zoom, Orbit, Handheld).

## How to Use

**Command**:
> "Optimize the visuals for this scene: A car chase in the rain."

**What Happens**:
The Agent analyzes your simple request and applies the "Cinematic Layer".

**Result**:
```markdown
### Visual Upgrade
**Gear**: Arri Alexa Mini with Cooke S4 Prime Lenses.
**Lighting**: High-contrast street lamps reflecting on wet asphalt; red tail-light trails.
**Texture**: Raindrops beading on the waxed hood; steam rising from the tires.
**Action**: Low-angle tracking shot, camera vibrating with the engine roar.
```

**Best Practice**:
Always run this skill *before* generating the final prompt or storyboard to ensure the highest quality input.
