### Cinematic Jungle Sequence — Full Translation

**Cinematic 4K, 24fps, aspect ratio 16:9, tropical jungle morning mist.**  
The protagonist, _Ozawa_ (a Japanese man in his 30s, wearing a plain black T-shirt and olive cargo pants, covered in mud and sweat).  
“Raging wild” = energy unleashed into the wilderness — running, roaring, jumping, dynamically brushing through branches.  
However, no depictions of cruelty or violence toward others.

The greenery is deep emerald, with fine, humid particles and faint rim light.  
Sound design includes raindrops, insects, and distant thunder (if no sound is generated, it’s implied visually).  
Lens characteristics and composition are faithfully represented.  
Movement is natural and weighty, with intentionally varied depth of field and soft motion blur.

Depict the swaying, texture of fabric, and sweat highlights.  
Color grading should resemble _Kodak Vision3_ style — low saturation, rich deep greens, and slightly warm skin tones.
